# Joe Biden's Policy Proposals
## Education
### Student Loan Debt
#### "Guaranteeing every American the skills and education they need to get ahead."
"Education is at the heart of the American Dream, and essential for the United States to compete globally in the decades to come. Every American should have the opportunity throughout their lives to obtain the skills and education to realize their full potential—starting long before they enter kindergarten, and all the way through a certificate program, on-the-job training, community college, or a four-year degree. And everyone should have the opportunity to update their skills as rapidly as the economy changes."

### Tax Policy

#### "Rewarding work, not just wealth."
"Economic inequality is pulling this country apart. We need stronger labor laws and a tax code that rewards a middle class that’s been cut out of decades of economic growth—not just the wealthy, who have gotten too many tax breaks for too long."

#### Tax Code
> The tax cut he passed, for multimillionaires and billionaires. Guess what? When I'm president, it's gone. It's gone. I don't want to punish anybody. Folks we need a fairer tax code. You realize when Reagan was president there were about $800 billion in [what] they call tax expenditures, meaning things we don't collect taxes on. Not tax cuts, tax expenditures: loopholes.

> Well, guess what, you know what it is today? One trillion, four hundred billion dollars. You can't find [me] an economist anywhere in this state that will tell you there's justification socially, politically or in *[sic]* any economic reason for more, for at least 500 billion dollars of that money. Imagine what we could do. We don't have to hurt anybody by eliminating. We don't have to punish anybody including the rich. But everyone should start paying their fair share a little bit. When I'm president, we're going to have a fair tax code and we're going to invest in people. We're going to invest in the economy. We're going to invest in things that make America grow. We are going to get rid of $100 billion in tax loopholes. There's no, no rationale. I'm gonna build an economy that doesn't just reward wealth but build an economy that rewards work. Work. Work. Think about it. Think about it. Look, I have nothing against the wealthy but they don't need it. They know they don't need another tax break. They know it.
