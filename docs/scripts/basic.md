## Welcome

**Facilitator**
Welcome everyone. Thank you so much for taking the time join us together so that we can all have a more satisfying 
democracy.

## Introductions

**Facilitator**
Let's begin by sharing our names and pronouns. Also, what brought you here. I'll start first.

My name is Ben. The pronouns I use are "he", "him" and "his" as well as "they", "them" and "theirs". What brings me here is the desire to see a world that works for everyone where we can all take each other seriously.

*Everyone shares their names, pronouns and purpose.*

## Process & Purpose

Our main objective for the today is to come up with meaningful questions to ask the people whom we share our planet with. Some of these people are those who run for office and we are negotiating expectations with. Some are currently in office and we must help them uphold the will of the people. We shall ask questions to activists that increase our mutual understanding of each other. We may also need to help each other understand how different people come to the conclusions that they make and how to be free to make decisions that we can all be proud of.

We shall first plan together based on the complete interest of the group what we want to work on today.
We shall then make a plan for how we want to work together today.
Using our plan we shall practice investigating and researching different ways the issue can be approached.
We shall make up questions that we could ask to specific people that might help us make places that we all want to live together in. 

My purpose here as a facilitator is to make sure that we all get what matters to us as earthlings who want to understand each other and be represented by our elected officials. I am also here to make sure that we work towards our purpose and not against it. I may at times have to step in to remind members of the group the ground rules.

## Container

We are now going to make a container of agreements and expectations so that we can all work towards our objective together effectively.

* Please allow everyone to speak without interruption.
* We also ask that we not share what our personal political views are to the group. We can legitimately achieve our purpose without sharing our individual views publically although we shall have a chance to write down privately our current satisfaction. We then review group priorities together.
* We ask that everyone treat one another respectfully: no name calling, personal attacks, misgendendering, racism, sexism, ablism, ageism, or descrimination is allowed.
* We ask that you actively request consent rather than assume consent.
* If we need to keep things flowing, I may step in to put things right.

Are there any questions or potential additions to our container?

Does everyone agree to our container? Thumbs up thumbs down?

*Shows a thumbs up and waits for everyone to decide*

## Assess Interest

*Passes out paper if not already passed out*
Does everyone have paper? We are now going to assess what everyone in the group wants to work on without everyone having to know everyone's personal opinions. I'm going to ask you two questions and I want you to write your answers on the paper. Are you ready?
*Shows a "thumbs up."*

On a scale of one to ten, one being this presidency not been good at all to ten being that there could not be a more perfect presidency, how satisfied are you with the current president?

*Waits till everyone looks done.*

Are you ready for the next question?

*Shows a thumbs up?*

What could the president do to be a ten?

*Waits till everyone looks done.*

May I collect your answers now?

*The facilitator collects all the answers."*

In order to make it difficult to know who thinks what and to give you more choices, I'm going to had a few more responses from other places. You will then be free to decide how you want to focus our work. Now I'm going to go through and read each response including the additional responses. As I read each issue that that could improve satisfaction. At the end you can rank each possibility from what is most important to you and what is least important. One being the most important and the largest number being the least important.

### Example Result
The most freqently rated important one is tax policy, so let's begin with tax policy. Shall we begin there?
*Does another "thumbs up" temperature check."*

## Research

If you have a smart phone or laptop you can help us research this issue.

There are a few questions that we need to answer in order to be able to be free and sufficiently informed to feel we are prepared to make a decision if we had to. We at Ballot Knowledge Network are not going to help you make a decision, we are just going to help you get ready.

Here are some of the questions we shall address:

1. What polling is available on how people currently feel about this issue?
2. What is the current president currently doing on this issue?
3. What is the evidence offered that it is effective?
4. What is the evidence offered that it is ineffective?
5. What money is the current president taking from people with a stake in this issue?
6. What is the current president planning on doing going forward?

We shall also ask the same questions of anyone who is a candidate for president, too.

Are there any questions anyone feels we have left out?

*If anyone suggests a question, you can ask if the group finds it important and take a vote*

You are welcome to participate as much or as little as you would like. Would anyone in the room like to start researching these questions using, DuckDuckGo, Google or another search engine using your smart phone or a computer? I shall also do it on the projector as we go.

*If people raise there hands ask them: "what would you like to focus on?"*

*The facilitator begins to Google one of the topics.*

### Questions That Can Be Asked
* What sources do we currently have?

*When looking at a source:*
* What in your own words are they trying to communicate?
* Can you explain how this recurring element hangs together with other pieces in the big picture?
* Do we know if this part is true? How?

## Brainstorming Questions

Now that we gathered information about this issue, let's start practice at asking questions.

Who can we ask questions to?

Some examples are:

* A friend or neighbor who doesn't know where to start and requests our help
* An activist or "expert" who we may want to understand better
* A candidate who we want to be more specific

What are some examples of questions?

For Joe Biden: "You said that during the Reagan era, there were about $800 billion in tax expenditures. You also said that there is currently one trillion four hundred billion dollars in tax expenditures. In addition you said that 500 billion dollars of that money is unjustified. Why do you then propose that we only get rid of $100 billion in tax loopholes?"

## Measures Of A Good Question
* Is it honest or does it take advantage of people who are not informed?
* Does it use known information to gather more?
* What might the question accomplish for the person being asked the question or for the constituency they serve.

## Satisfaction Survey

Before we all go, I would like to ask you to briefly participate in helping us improve this. Does everyone have a sheet of paper? Again on a scale of 1 to 10 how satisfied were you with this training?

*After everyone has stopped writing:*

Is everyone finished? The second question is: what could we do to be a ten?

*When everyone is done*

Is everyone done? Would anyone like to share your response? We shall be using this to make a qualitative satisfaction survey, if you'd like to receive the survey, put your name and email address or postal address on your sheet of paper.
