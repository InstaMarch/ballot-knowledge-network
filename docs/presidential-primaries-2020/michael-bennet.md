# Michael Bennet Policies

## Healthcare
* “We need to fix healthcare…affordable high-quality health insurance with a public option that will guarantee competition in every county in America and lower drug prices.  And that’s Not Medicare for All, because I don’t think 180 million Americans want to give up the insurance they already have through their work or their union.”

## Education
* "I am not going to pretend that Free College is the answer. I am not going to say there is a simple solution to a problem if I don’t believe there is one."

* "Michael will work to ensure that all of our children receive a high-quality education, from early childhood through high school; college students can pursue their studies without incurring the crushing burden of debt; more people seeking an alternative to college can pursue high-quality apprenticeships and job training; and Americans throughout their lives can advance their careers by improving their existing job skills or learning new ones."

## Tax
* "Michael’s plan to overhaul and expand the Child Tax Credit, called the American Family Act, will help middle-class families afford to raise their kids and cut child poverty by nearly 40%." 
* " He also will expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, ensure equal pay for equal work, enact paid family and medical leave, make it easier for workers to bargain for better pay, and raise the minimum wage."
